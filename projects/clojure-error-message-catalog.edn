 "## What is \"Clojure Error Message Catalog\"?\n\nA collection of errors and exceptions with their causes and possible solutions to help new comers as well as experience Clojure developers.\n\nThe errors are split into 3 groups:\n\n* Clojure\n* ClojureScript\n* Libraries\n\nAnd aim to solve most common and not errors that are raised from Clojure/Script itself or from any of the thousands of Clojure libraries.\n\n## Contributing to the catalog\n\nThis catalog really needs you, whether you are a beginner and stumbled upon an error/exception or you are an experienced developer that can share a solution. At the end both sides win :)\n\n### What to do to participate:\n\n* git clone git@github.com:yogthos/clojure-error-message-catalog.git\n*  cd clojure-error-message-catalog\n*  add your `.md` (i.e. markdown) file to an appropriate group: `clj` / `cljs` or `lib`\n* commit, push, send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)\n* profit\n\n## Let's talk!\n\nany questions or feedback, tell us about it on [clojurians slack](https://clojurians.slack.com) (@tolitius, @yogthos), or just open a [github issue](https://github.com/yogthos/clojure-error-message-catalog/issues).",
