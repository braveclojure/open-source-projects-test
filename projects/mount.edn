 "## What is Mount?\n\nMount aims to preserve all the Clojure/Script superpowers while managing dependencies between stateful components and making the application state enjoyably reloadable whether it is within the REPL, a Clojure editor, or simply anywhere programmatically at runtime.\n\nThere is another Clojure superpower that mount is made to retain: The Clojure Community. Pull request away, let's solve this thing!\n\n## Developing the project locally\n\n* git clone git@github.com:tolitius/mount.git\n*  cd mount\n*  boot repl OR lein repl\n*  when in REPL type (dev) to get all the dependencies and dev niceties setup for you.\n\n## Running tests\n\n* boot test test-cljs OR lein do test, doo phantom test once\n\n## Builds\n\nthere is a circle ci [build status](https://circleci.com/gh/tolitius/mount). The build will kick off on any push / pull request and will show you builds for across the branches\n\n## Let's talk!\n\nany questions or feedback, tell us about it on [#mount](https://clojurians.slack.com/messages/mount/) clojurians slack, or just open a github issue",
